# micro-phone
Welcome to the micro;phone repository. Here, we will store the code and upload all newest versions of the micro;phone Wizard, an app coded on Visual Basic to make the usage of code made for the micro;bit much easier.
## How does it work?
The Wizard is basically a glorified file copying program. It detects if any of the drives contain the file DETAILS.TXT, which only micro;bits have, then it uses a ComboBox to detect the program which the user wishes to use, and copies the file stored in the project folder to the drive.
## What are its functions?
### Communicator
The communicator works by transmitting individual words to another micro;bit on the same group.
### Calculator
A normal calculator, but on the micro;bit. Nothing else.
### Countdown
A normal countdown, but on the micro;bit. Nothing elshave.
### Custom
If you have your own snippet, use this and the browse button to insert it into the micro;bit.
## Forking policy
It would be very nice of you to give us appropiate credit.
